        <h3>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>
        <P>littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,incompatible DOMS, broken CSS
          support, and abandoned browser</P>
        <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of
          folk like the W3C,WSAP, and the major browser creators</p>
        <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the impiortant lessons of the masters. Begin to see
          with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the
          web.</p>

        <h3>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h3>
        <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of css. The Zen Garden aims to ecite,inspire, and encourage
          participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list.Clicking on any one will load the style
          sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS
          file. Yes,really.</p>
        <p>css allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext doccument. The only way this can be
          illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what is can truly be, once the reins are
          placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed
          to the beaut;y of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

        <h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>
        <P>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are
          necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as staring
          points. Please see the <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources/"
            title="A listing of CSS-related resources"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Resource
            Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.</P>
        <p>You may modify the style sheet in an;y way you wish,but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at frist if
          you've never worked this way before, but follow the listed to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
        </p>
        <p>Download the sample <a href="/examples/index"
            title="This page's source HTML code, not to be modified">HTML</a> and <a href="examples/style.css"
            title="This page's sample CSS, the file you may modify.">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally.Once you have
          completed your masterpiece (and please,don't submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server
          under your control. <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/"
            title="Use the contact form to send us your CSS file">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and all
          associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.</p>

        <h3>BENEEITS</h3>
        <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing
          CSS really
          can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for
          those who will
          be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="requirements" id="zen-requirements" role="article">
        <h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
        <P>Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported
          elements
          only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not
          the latest
          bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your CSS
          validates.</P>
        <P>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the
          guidelines
          you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents
          on the web
          these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every
          platform.
          That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest
          Chrome, Firefox,
          iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</P>
        <P>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to
          a minimum,
          and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point of needing
          another
          garden-related design.</P>
        <P>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with
          limited
          exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we ask you release your CSS under a Creative Commons license
          identical to
          the one on this site so that others may learn from your work.</P>
